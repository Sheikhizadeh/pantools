Requirements
------------
- KMC: is a disk-based programm for counting k-mers from 
       (possibly gzipped) FASTQ/FASTA files
       (http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/kmc).
        You need to download it and add the path to the 
        appropriate version (linux, macos or windows) of kmc 
        and kmc_tools executables to your OS path environment 
        variable.

- Java Virtual Machine version 1.8 or higher: Add the path to 
       the java executable to your OS path environment variable.

- MCL: The Markov Cluster Algorithm, is a fast and scalable 
       unsupervised cluster algorithm for graphs 
       (http://micans.org/mcl ) which is needed for group 
       functionality of PanTools.
       You need to download, unzip and compile it (see README), 
       and add the path to the mcl executable to your path
       environment variable.

Visualization in the Neo4j browser
----------------------------------
   Neo4j browser allows you to run Cypher queries and receive 
   the results in a tabular or a graph representation mode. 
   You need to download the appropriate version of Neo4j. 
   To visualize the pangenome of two HIV strains provided 
   as a sample data in pantools repositiory, take these actions 
   on a linux machine. Windows users could also download the
   Neo4j desktop application for starting and stopping a server 
   instead of usingn commandline.
1. Add the path to the Neo4j /bin directory to the path 
   environment variable.
2. Hard-code the path to your pangenome in the configuration file 
   ,NEO4J-DIRECTORY/conf/neo4j.conf, by: 
   dbms.directories.data = PATH_TO_THE_PANGENOME_DATABASE
3. Start the Neo4j database server by: 
   neo4j start
4. open an internet browser and Open the URL http://localhost:7474
5. To visualize the whole pangenome of two HIV strains, 
   type this simple Cypher command:
   MATCH (n) RETURN n
6. To stop the Neo4j server type:
   neo4j stop
